How to Raise Political Contributions Online

 **Section 0  - About this guide **

The target audience of this guide ranges from election professionals to new candidates running for office. The motivation of this guide is to correct outdated campaign guides on the web, so you can learn about modern online and mobile fundraising techniques. 

 **Section I - Initial Steps **

Having a website is not enough, in fact it has become quite easy to do so. Today, http://Nationbuilder.com offers a pay for subscription service that allows you to quickly create a website for your campaign and connect your facebook friends to this site. While the offering is interesting and fulfils some fundraising techniques, the more critical question is how will you reach out to individuals to make an online fundraising appeal?

Today, mobile rules. The latest social networks are not facebook or twitter but snapchat, Instagram and Whats App. Mastering online fundraising will require much more than a webpage, facebook account and twitter presence - this presence could go unnoticed. Success in fundraising will require a mastery of analytics, capturing the right information and sending the appropriate message to the appropriate audience.

When beginning your campaign you should make the following steps:

1. Collect a list of registered voters at your local Board of Elections
2. Research individuals who contribute to campaigns: http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/norindsea.shtml
3. Rank individuals, based on the likelihood they will give to your campaign.
4. Use Social Networks and the web to Research the interests of the individuals on your list. Try to fit your list of people into Audiences you define

 **Section II - Define your audience **

The Obama Campaign used many audiences in order to communicate with voters. A short list of these profiles includes: african americans, asian americans, educators, environmentalists, healthcare workers, labor, latinos, LGBT, rural voters, seniors, small business owners, students, women, young professionals, gun rights and veterans.

When tailoring a fundraising appeal youâ€™ll be more successful when you engage in meaningful dialog. If a voter's top issue is the environment, is a member of the Sierra Club, and they donate every election cycle, you will have the most success with a special appeal based on your stance of environmental issues and what you can do to achieve progress towards this issue. 

 **Section II - Multi Channel Fundraising  **

Setting up fundraising has never been easier than today. http://redmeetsblue.org is a free service that leverages the stripe payment gateway. With Stripe you simply connect your bank account and contributions are sent weekly. Other free alternatives include fundly, paypal, and kickstarter, but none of these alternatives provide FEC/state compliance tools you will need. Payment gateways in the political sphere, which do provide compliance include Nationbuilder, NGP-Van, campaigngrid. All of these services require a monthly fee. While this article is inherently bias in favor of redmeetsblue, you should check out the alternatives to compare features and value. 

 **Section III - Measure Conversion and Success **

Once you have set up your fundraising solution, you need to begin reaching out to your targeted Audiences, with your custom messaging. How can you be sure someone has opened a link? How can you be sure someone has opened an email? And how can you reach out to these people?

Luckily there are a number of free solutions to help you answer the above concerns. bit.ly is a url shortener, with associated link tracking. For example, it could shorten http://redmeetsblue.org -> http://bit.ly/1kDFEIn This new link has assoicated tracking features, so you can be certain when a link has been clicked on. http://mailchimp.com/ offers email solutions, that provide email tracking, so you can be sure your emails are being recieved, and read. And how about managing all of your contacts? Both http://redmeetsblue.org and Nationbuilder offer a Donor Profile service. redmeetsblue.org is free, and nationbuilder has a monthly service fee.
