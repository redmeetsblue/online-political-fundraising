How to Raise Political Contributions Online
—

#####Section 0  - Welcome!

Congratulations! You have successfully enabled your campaign to fundraise with redmeetsblue. This guide will enable your campaign to maximize its fundraising using the redmeetsblue tool. 

#####Section I - Posting to social media

redmeetsblue works best using social media. We recommend that you use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to highlight your fundraising page.

Hashtags are an important feature to use when crafting your message. Hashtags begin with “#” followed by a keyword. For example consider the tag #economy. When a user on Instagram or Twitter clicks on this hashtag, a search for the term “economy” is completed. Your fundraising appeal could show up in this search. This is an excellent way to gain free advertising for your campaign. 

You can use social media to piggyback on famous hashtags. For example many Democratic candidates use the hashtag #p2 and conservative candidates #tcot. These are short abbreviations for “progressive” and “true conservatives on twitter” - but using these tags in conjunction with your post, could lead to exposure to a targeted group of people. 

We recommend you post to social media, at least once per day, at a time when many other people are using social media, between 10am-3pm. 

Remember these tips:

1. Include a short message relevant message
2. Link to your fundraising page
3. Use custom hashtags - the issue tags you are running on, relevant to the message you crafted.
4. Consider including common hashtags such as #tcot or #p2

Example message:

Help support Jason Wade’’s plans to revitalize the #WoodCounty #economy #p2 #moneybomb https://redmeetsblue.org/jason-wade-for-mayor/
